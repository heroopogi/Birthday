            <p><strong>Happy 23rd Birthday, Bab!</strong></p>
            <p>Three years have passed since I first started celebrating your birthday with you, and every year since then has been a blessing. I still remember the very first time I greeted you on your special day. It felt like the start of something beautiful, and I’m so grateful that I’ve been able to share this day with you. Each year, I try to think of something meaningful to give you, something that will surprise you and remind you of how much you mean to me. This year, I wanted to create something lasting, something you can always come back to, so I made this website just for you. Because you are not just special, you are the most special person in my life.</p>
            <p>Bab, I can’t put into words how thankful I am that I met you. You’ve given me more than I could ever ask for. You’ve given me love, patience, laughter, and a sense of home. You’ve given me the universe in the way you care for me, in the way you stand by me, and in the way you make even the simplest days feel extraordinary. You are always there for me, even when I stumble, even when I make mistakes. Thank you for your unending love, for your patience when I fall short, and for believing in me when I don’t always believe in myself.</p>
            <p>I know there are times when I give you headaches and stress, and for that I’m truly sorry. But please know that I am always trying, always giving my best for you, because you deserve nothing less. You inspire me to grow, to be better, and to love more deeply. You make me want to be the best version of myself, not just for me but for us.</p>
            <p>Today marks your 23rd year in this world. Another year to dream bigger, to chase your goals, to discover new experiences, and to create memories that you’ll carry with you forever. I’m so proud of you, Bab. Proud of everything you’ve accomplished, proud of the person you are today, and proud of the person you are becoming. I know you will achieve so much more, and I will always be here, cheering you on, supporting you, and walking beside you through every step of your journey.</p>
            <p>As you celebrate this special day, I want you to remember how deeply loved you are, not just by me but by everyone whose lives you’ve touched. You bring light, joy, and strength into the world simply by being yourself. And to me, you are my greatest blessing, my safe place, and my forever.</p>
            <p>So here’s to you, Bab, on your 23rd birthday and for all the years to come. May this year bring you happiness, success, and countless reasons to smile. May you always feel how loved and cherished you are. And may we continue to build more memories together, hand in hand, heart to heart.</p>
            <p>I love you, Bab. Always and forever.</p>
